# Overview

The goal of a solution doc is to outline a clear and actionable plan for implementing a unified agent that effectively 
leverages generative AI to route conversations to the appropriate actions and integrations. This document serves as a blueprint for developers
and project managers by providing a detailed roadmap for the overall implementation and configuration of various generative AI capabilities and third-party integrations,
as well as outlining the necessary infrastructure and workflows. 

This solution doc will address the different use cases for this soltuion, as well as outline the necessary requirements for building out each solution component to ultimately 
demonstrate a successful implementation of the unified agent with generative AI capabilities.
